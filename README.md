# Project1-Horiseon-Code-Refactor
Refactor the existing code for web accesability.

## Description
For the delivery and acceptance of the Horiseon Code refactor project, the code needs to be updated with Semantic HTML. The initial code to refactor had "divs" instead of Semantic HTML that follows accessability standards.
The clearest definition of Semantic HTML is: "A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and developer" 
Using semantic HTML is noted as part of HTML5 standard ([FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/semantic-html-alternatives-to-using-divs/)).
Important reasons to write the code with Semantic HTML:
- it's easier to read and to decipher the layout
- it's accesable and readable to visually impaired people
- it's easier to make changes and apply the CSS for the HTML document that was written for
- search engines will read its contents as important keywords to influence the page serach rankings ([MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics))

## Installation
1. Downloaded the [**starter code**](https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/uk-16/activities/01-html-git-github-module/04-code-refactor-lesson/challenge.zip) and unziped the file
2. Created a new **repository** in my GitHub account [Project1-Horison-Code-Refactor](https://github.com/iibusiness20/Project1-Horiseon-Code-Refactor/tree/main)
3. Added the starter code to the the new repo in VSCode and worked through the Challenge.
4. Before deployment (after all changes were done regarding the usage of Semantic HTML) I used the following commands: **git add**, **git commit** and **git push** to save and push the code to my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iibusiness20/Project1-Horiseon-Code-Refactor/tree/main)
5. For deployment I went to my GitHub repository in the browser and then I selected Settings tab on the right hand side of the page, scrolled down to GitHib Pages section, in the section labeled **Source** I selected the **main** branch as my source.
6. After a couple of minutes I navigated to [Settings - my GitHub pages (left hand side menu scroll down)](github.com/iibusiness20//Project1-Horison-Code-Refactor/settings/pages) and I saw that the [page has gone live](iibusiness20.github.io/Project1-Horison-Code-Refactor/).
